## NumPy ##

Numpy is a popular library for performing data analysis. Numpy allows developers to more easily handle large datasets, such as large CSV files that contain different types of data. Here are a few of the important concepts to understand about Numpy.

Numpy Arrays

- Numpy uses arrays rather than regular Python lists.
- If we pass in a list to the function numpy.array(), it will automatically create a new Numpy array.
- Numpy arrays are immutable unlike python lists
- Numpy arrays can be sliced the same way as python lists
- You can perform mathematical operations on an array and it will apply the operation to each of the elements in the array
- Numpy arrays have some array operations such as array.sum(), array.mean(), array.std(), array.min(), array.max()

## Jupyter Lab ##

JupyterLab enables you to work with documents and activities such as Jupyter Notebooks. Jupyter Notebooks are very useful for data science projects because they allow analysts to run python scripts on csv files without much setup of an environment. The notebooks are easily reproduced and can even embed markdown for visually appealing documentation.
